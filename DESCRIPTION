Description: Provides a high-performance Rust backend for the
    'metabodecon' package
    (<https://github.com/spang-lab/metabodecon>), enabling
    efficient deconvolution, alignment, and post-processing of
    1-dimensional (1D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra.
    The package wraps optimized Rust functions to improve
    performance and scalability for large datasets. The
    recommended way to use *mdrb* is by installing *metabodecon*
    and setting the backend argument to "rust" when calling its
    functions. The Rust part of the package is based on the
    'metabodecon-rust' crate
    (<https://github.com/SombkeMaximilian/metabodecon-rust>).
